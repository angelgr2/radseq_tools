# RADseq_Tools #

R pipeline for the exploratory analysis of RADseq data to guide researchers in planning their study and improving their data quality.
This pipeline allows researchers to estimate important information of r the initial experiment design, indcluding: the number of cutsites in a reference genome of a study taxa or closely related study taxa, the density of markers and distribution through the genome, and estimated genome coverage given various restriction enzymes, reference genomes, and standard sequencing machines. Even when there is not reference genome available for a particular species of interest, the user can explore with available genomes in related taxa and use this information to extrapolate the marker properties for their own experiments.
